## FAKE INFO

### Vision Statement
Our mission is to allow people to achieve their potential in studying regardless of status or ability. We are committed to a constant pursuit of innovation to achieve a simple and elegant interface. This allows individuals to create flash cards regardless of its complexity. 

### Overview
Spatial repetition and active recall are important factors and influences to remembering content. The application Swish Cards is based on maximizing these factors to help people remember anything. 

For example, a card may be multiple choice, a drawn visual, yes or no answers, or basic text responses. Furthermore, revising flash card decks becomes easier with various functionalities that competitors fail to implement. Virtual reality, drawing based answers and a simple interface is utilised to give the user the best experience possible. Ultimately, the application has an easy to use interface while supporting complex functionalities that competitors fail to integrate.

Since the application is designed for mobile devices, multiple factors were considered. This paper will go into detail about the following: screen sizes, gestures and performance capabilities. 


## Progression
This project was created for University. Therefore, the code written may be suboptimal. For instance, LocalBroadcastListeners were used instead of CallBack methods to upscale skills.
The application will be discontinued after finishing the Unit the program is created for. 
Comments are used for documentation, however, elaborate documentation is not created.
